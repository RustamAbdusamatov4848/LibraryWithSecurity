# Web-Library

### **Brief description of the project**

This is my second full-fledged project using the Spring framework. **[Here's first project link](https://github.com/RustamAbdusamatov4848/LibraryWithJDBCTemplate)**. 
The essence of this project is to provide simple functionality for an online library, where a conditional librarian has 2 tables (a list of people and a list of books). 
The librarian and the person who borrows books from the library have different access to library data.



## Usage
The librarian has the ability to:

1. Librarian authorization and registration
1. View your book list;
2. Add/Edit and remove reader from the database;
2. Add / Edit and delete books from the database;
4. Give out books to a certain reader, or after the reader returned the book back to the library, mark it in the database.
5. Search books. I plan to add a reader search function in the future.
